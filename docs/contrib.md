# Contributting to DANIX

Contributting will fall under these rules:

* Format code so it is easily readable and editable
* Use single-line comments when needed
* Please don't use unnecessary code
* Provide a good description on why your idea(s) or code should be added

If you do have any questions or comments, just ask it in the discussions tab.
